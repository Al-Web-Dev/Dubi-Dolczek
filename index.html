      <H2>About Dubi</H2>
      <p>Ralph J Gleeson- (exclusive talk with Dubi Dolczek upon the release of ‘Dubi In Space: episode 1- The Emerald Gauntlet’)
          The foyer is tense as I wait for Dubi Dolczek to arrive through the docking tube. I’m thinking Romagon is a strange place for an interview right now. But hell, Dolczek’s music has always transcended galactic politics. I’m finishing my second Vrendakian spritzer when he arrives, a languidly sprightly 35, in golden sport shorts. 

          “So what’s it all about Dubi, this Emerald Gauntlet? Is it any good?”
          “It’s hard to say… I can assure you though, that the Gauntlet itself was not made for evil.”
          Dubi falls silent at this point, looking troubled. I wonder if I’ve blown it. Perhaps a minute goes by, then that old gleam lights up in his gimlet eye once more. He continues jovially.
          “There are some nice songs, Laser Dojo, Only Human and some others… and fine work from the guys, y’know?”
          “Can you take us from the top?”
          “Sure. Well, I guess it begins in a courthouse on Daz.”
          “The planet where all the people are like little babies with grey hair their whole lives?”
          “Yes! That’s right. I was arrested with nubu buds and they’re tough about that on Daz. They held me and my crew in their dungeons for an afternoon. In there with me were Lazlo, King Plutax, Waxin’ Wayne, Chavez, Nixie, an old droid called Lothar and some others like Glubelo, Yoshino, The Milkshake Kid. Even Denby Sweeting, King of the Robins dropped by. ”
          1.ONLY HUMAN “I’d only been there on Daz a couple of days but it made an indelible impression on me. I hated it. They were babies, and yet such surly pomposity I’d never seen. I had already written the first verse and I was thinking of more of a punk thing actually at the time, when they arrested me. My attitude softened when I realized how easily I could overpower them and I guess I saw how like myself, and Earth society it all was. So the song became more contemplative and avuncular.”
          “A huge hit here on Romagon of course.”
